# Responsive Image Loader

Uses PHP and AJAX to load responsive images in main content.

After content is retrieved on the server-side (from a database or proxy source), but before content is served up to the browser, we parse the content on the server side and replace all the image tags in the content area with anchor tags that link to the image they're replacing. We add data attributes to the anchor tag that carry additional information about the image (classes, alt text, dimensions). This way when the page loads, no image requests are actually made and if the user has JS disabled they are still served working links to the images (works for SEO as well). Once the page has loaded, and if JavaScript is enabled, we get all the links in the content containing our data attribute that tells us they were originally images, We also get the width of their parent element. We use that width to determine how big the image we serve up in place of the link should be.

Also we are using `img { height: auto; max-width: 100%; }` in our CSS to ensure the images continue to scale with their parents are the width of the page changes (making it cross-device friendly). Though loading the page at a small width and increasing the browser width will cause the image to pixelate.
